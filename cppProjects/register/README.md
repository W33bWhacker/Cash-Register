# Overview

Since this is my first C++ program, I thought to create a software that would be useful for an embedded system, since that is primarily what C languages are used for.

This software simulates the function of a cash register. To keep it simple, rather than create a shopping cart portion of the program, this program will randomly generate a total price owed to the cent. It will then accept inputs as a number for each applicable denomination you wish to use to pay for the total price. It will then output the change based on the calculated value of the amount of denominations in which you paid.

# Future Work

* Read and write to a file, simulating a receipt.
* Have the program output the most efficient number of each US denomination making up the total change.
* Implement error prevention.
